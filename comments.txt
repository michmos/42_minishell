some comment here:

- something with redir lst doesn't work in in file and out file
	it can't access what is needed properly, and gives errors for last_in last_output
	so focus on that and hopefully the rest would fall in

- if that helps, but not fully. i'll have to take a look at pipes and redirections in other places

- last but not least, signals are still not working as they should, so after everything else is fixed 
	focus on signals
